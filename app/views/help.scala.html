                <h4>Coach List</h4>
                <p>
                    The users list will display all users and allow quick-scheduling to a specific coach via a button in the manage section of the page. Each coach will have a button corresponding to them.

                <p>
                    The dashboard will display your next 5 appointments, along with a week-view calendar of all appointments this week.
                    The next 5 appointment list will also contain a button to view the appointment list.
                </p>
                <h4>Appointment List</h4>
                <p>
                    Within the appointment list, users and students can access and alter important information around each appointment.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>Students:</b>
                    Students can easily view all of their upcoming & past appointments, as well as cancel any upcoming ones using the appointment controls.
                    An additional button will also allow students to email their coach quickly.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>Coaches:</b>
                    In the appointment list users can quickly email students, cancel appointments, as well as add coach notes to each appointment.
                    Coach notes are not visible by students, but are the equivalent to session logs, and allow users to stay on top of topics and review what was discussed
                    or completed in previous appointments.

                <h4>Services</h4>
                <p>
                    Services are defined by each individual learning center. They are custom attributes that can be attached to specific users, and used to filter available appointment slots.
                    For example, a coach may be able to provide help with "Writing", where other users may not. This "Writing" service will appear in the dropdown "Service" for creating a new appointment.
                    Another example may be to create classes as services, if users are able to provide help in a class such as CS3000, where other users may not have taken it yet.
                </p>
                <h4>Appointment Types</h4>
                <p>
                    Like services, appointment types can be set by each individual learning center. The three most commonly used appointment types consist of One-Time and Weekly.
                    Appointment types are used to determine what frequency or mode the appointment will take place. For instance, some appointment availabilities may only be created to facilitate a weekly spot.
                    Another example may be Online appointments, where users can mark availability times to allow online submissions only.
